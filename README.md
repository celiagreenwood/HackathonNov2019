# HackathonNov2019
Data for Hackathon on November 21, 2019

In this repository are some genotype data from several populations in the 1000 Genomes Project, and a simulated trait phenotype.  The files are in PLINK format. 

The general goal of the hackathon is to look at how polygenic risk scores (PRS) developed in one population perform when applied to another population, and then to brainstorm on why there are differences in performance and possibly how to improve performance.
